GET Form Handling:

The following is a form example to get a "first" and "last" name.

<form method="get">
First name: <input type="text" name="first">
<br>
Last name: <input type="text" name="last">
<br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Name">
</form>

When the form is submitted the data gets stored into $_GET superglobal array

The data is also stored in the $_REQUEST superglobal 

<?=$_GET['first'];?>

would store the last name.
