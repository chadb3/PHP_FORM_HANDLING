in this lesson,

you are FORCED to put the solution exactly like the following or it will be marked WRONG

    $_REQUEST:
    <?php print_r($_REQUEST);?>
    <br>
    $_GET:
    <?php print_r($_GET);?>
    <br>
    $_POST:
    <?php print_r($_POST);?>


I had it like the following and it was marked wrong despite it not printing any different.

    $_REQUEST:
    <?php #Print REQUEST data here
    print_r ($_REQUEST);?>
    <br>
    $_GET:
    <?php #Print GET data here 
    print_r ($_GET); ?>
    <br>
    $_POST:
    <?php #Print POST data here 
    print_r($_POST);?>
