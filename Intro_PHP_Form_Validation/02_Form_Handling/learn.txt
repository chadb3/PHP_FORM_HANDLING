Form Handling:

This lesson focuses on using the POST method attribute for more secure input submissions.

All data will be stored in "$_POST" array. 

POST is said to be "for more secure input submission."

to store data, each input field in under the POST method form needs to have a "name".

example:

<form method="post" ..>
What is ...: <input type="text" name="user_input1">
<input type="submit" value="submit Language">
</form>

echo $_POST["user_input1"]; //prints what ever the user input
